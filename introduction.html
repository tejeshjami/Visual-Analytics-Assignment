    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I am Tejesh Jami. I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Information Technology with Advanced Data and Knowledge Discovery as my Concentration. I have completed my undergraduate studies in the Electronics and Communication as my major from R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering, India. I have completed a project on Detecting masses in mammogram images using deep learning techniques. I know different languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, SQL, and CSS. I am also interested in developing web applications. I am excited to apply my passion for creating innovative, user-centric applications that has a meaningful impact on our interconnected world as I continue my academic journey and prepare to transition into a professional software engineering role.</p>


    <h2>My Education</h2>
    <p>I have completed my undergraduate from R.V.R. & J.C. College of Engineering with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2021.</p>

    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>Here is some information about my undergraduate project:</p>
    <ul>
        <h3>Project 1: Detection of masses in digital Mamogram images</h3>
        <li>Using the numerous datasets available, we assessed the YOLOv4 model for breast mass identification. Since YOLOv4 is based on the anchor boxes principle, which is overlooked in several other versions of YOLO(You Only Look Once), it produces the best results. Additionally, in order to enhance the dataset size and improve the results, we performed data augmentation. Our findings offer realistic and encouraging outcomes in terms of locating masses and identifying their appropriate classes.</li>
